# RockyMountainAphids
Host plant-aphid association data from M.E. Palmer's (1952) "Aphids of the Rocky Mountain region: Including primarily Colorado and Utah, but also bordering area composed of southern Wyoming, southeastern Idaho and northern New Mexico"

This database contains host associations for 481 accepted aphid species in 74 genera and feeding on 438 accepted plant taxa in 263 genera.

## Name cleaning
Host plant-aphid associations listed as an appendix (beginning p. 413) were digitized using OCR. Character recognition errors and taxonomic changes were corrected using (i) the iPlant Taxonomic Name Resolution Service (v.3.2) for plant names and (ii) the Global Names Index (beta) for aphids on 20 June 2017. For each, the highest scoring match was taken. No further error checking was done.
