## Name cleaning
Host plant-aphid associations listed as an appendix (beginning p. 413) were digitized using OCR. Character recognition errors and taxonomic changes were corrected using (i) the iPlant Taxonomic Name Resolution Service (v.3.2) for plant names and (ii) the Global Names Index (beta) for aphids on 20 June 2017. For each, the highest scoring match was taken. No further error checking was done.
